## Overview

this program allows users to load grid data, calculate various properties of the grid, identify dangerous cells, and provides the ability to retrieve both the original and calculated grid data in a safe and encapsulated manner. It's useful for analyzing grids of data, such as temperature or radiation levels, and identifying areas of concern.

## Compiling and Using

To use this program you need open gridmonitortest.java and click the run button. If you want to try out from a newly created grid you would need to create a new method in gridmonitortest.java

## Discussion

This was a very hard program to create and i failed mutliple times. I ended up using code from my professors and classmates to put together this program. I made sure to document everything so i got a clear understanding of what was going on. 

## Testing

There was alot of testing to get this program working. Alot of the testing was brought about from gridmonitortest.java
