## Overview
This project is a text-based adventure game. 
The game emulates a night in the wilderness for a party of RPG characters.
Each character has their own behaviors and attitudes during the encounters. 

## Compiling and Using
Using this game is very simple.
You simply have to click the run button in the upper right corner.
The game will run and dialogue will show in the terminal. No input needed.

## Discussion
If i could change this program i would totally add user input.
I didn't run into too many errors. I found this lab pretty straightforward and didn't use to much logic.
I had problems figuring out the getter and setter methods. ( i found the imlpementation later on)

## Testing
I have run the code and have had no issues.
There is no input needed so their is nothing that can break in the code.
