## Overview

This program is made to implement a set of classes and interfaces that can represent different RPG (Role-Playing 
Game) characters and the weapons they use.

The main loop can be found in Adventure.java

## Compiling and Using

It is easy to compile and use. You just have to run and the program does not need anything else.

If you want to change scenarios, characters, or weapons then you have to code it manually in Adventure.java .

## Discussion

I felt the use of parent and sub classes was a great use of time and learning about polymorphism.

I thought the instructions were pretty vague in my opionion.

I think there could have been better ways to create the characters that would have less repeating code and more for loops.

## Testing

It tooks me awhile to figure out how weapon behavior would work.
